# Hydrogen template: Hello World + HTTPS/SSL dev

Hydrogen is Shopifyâ€™s stack for headless commerce. Hydrogen is designed to dovetail with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Shopifyâ€™s full stack web framework. This template contains a **minimal setup** of components, queries and tooling to get started with Hydrogen.

## SSL dev instructions

Instructions for Mac:

One time install via your terminal

```bash
brew install mkcert
```

```bash
mkcert -install
```

```bash
npm install -g local-ssl-proxy
```

From the root folder of the hydrogen project run:

```bash
mkcert localhost
```

Should output:

```bas
Created a new certificate valid for the following names ðŸ“œ
 - "localhost"

The certificate is at "./localhost.pem" and the key at "./localhost-key.pem" âœ…

It will expire on XX Moth YYYY ðŸ—“
```

Finally, start the development server as usual with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The proxied HTTPS/SSL dev server will be available on `https://localhost:3010` and
the standard HTTP at `http://localhost:3000`
